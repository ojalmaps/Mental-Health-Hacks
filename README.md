# Mental-Health-Hacks

This is a project by Ojal M and Ashley for the Mental Health Hackthon.


In It Together is a website that serves as a resource for anyone looking to take a step back from their busy lives and slow down.
Users can navigate through the website to gain information about the importance of self-care practices such as eating well, staying physically active, getting and enough sleep.
